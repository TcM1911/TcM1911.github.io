      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over two years since the first public release of redress and a lot has changed since then. Redress has finally reached version 1.0. This release includes many surface and under the hood changes. One of the obvious changes is the user interface which has been rewritten to make it easier to use.
The Go Reverse Engineering Tool Kit (GoRE) has had a lot of improvements during the last few months and redress is taking advantage of these improvements.</description>

      <description>The Problem Within the last few releases, the Go compiler has gotten better at inlining smaller functions. This can sometimes make it harder when analyzing an unknown Go binary with a disassembler. Instead of seeing a call to a documented library function, the library function&amp;rsquo;s code has been &amp;ldquo;merged&amp;rdquo; with the caller and it is easy to waste time trying to decipher the library code when just reading the documentation would have been faster.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is showing how Radareâ€™s Zignatures can be used to create YARA rules. The YARA rules generated can be used to find other malware samples that have the same or similar code.
Yara YARA was created by Victor Alvarez of Virustotal and is a tool used by malware researchers to identify and classify samples. YARA rules consist of string or byte patterns together with set conditions. When the conditions are met, a match is found.</description>
