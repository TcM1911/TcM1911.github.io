      <description>Orthrus is a crypto-mining malware targeting both Windows and Linux machines. One of the first analyses of the Linux version of the malware was published by Antiy in June 2019. Since then, the threat actor has evolved the malware to also infect Windows servers. Orthrus is made up of four different modules written in Powershell, shell script, and binary executables. The binary executables are written in Go (Golang) and the Linux and Windows versions or compiled from the same source code.</description>
