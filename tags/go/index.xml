      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over two years since the first public release of redress and a lot has changed since then. Redress has finally reached version 1.0. This release includes many surface and under the hood changes. One of the obvious changes is the user interface which has been rewritten to make it easier to use.
The Go Reverse Engineering Tool Kit (GoRE) has had a lot of improvements during the last few months and redress is taking advantage of these improvements.</description>

      <title>Tackle Inline Go Functions</title>

      <description>The Problem Within the last few releases, the Go compiler has gotten better at inlining smaller functions. This can sometimes make it harder when analyzing an unknown Go binary with a disassembler. Instead of seeing a call to a documented library function, the library function&amp;rsquo;s code has been &amp;ldquo;merged&amp;rdquo; with the caller and it is easy to waste time trying to decipher the library code when just reading the documentation would have been faster.</description>

      <description>Orthrus is a crypto-mining malware targeting both Windows and Linux machines. One of the first analyses of the Linux version of the malware was published by Antiy in June 2019. Since then, the threat actor has evolved the malware to also infect Windows servers. Orthrus is made up of four different modules written in Powershell, shell script, and binary executables. The binary executables are written in Go (Golang) and the Linux and Windows versions or compiled from the same source code.</description>

      <description>Eris ransomware was first discovered in May 2019. In July it was reported by Bleeping Computer that the malware was being distributed by the RIG exploit kit.
Here is a set of analysis notes for version two of the family. The sample used for the analysis has the hash of 99d19dd82330a1c437a64e7ca9896ad9d914de10c4f7aa2222b1a5bc4750f692
Malware overview Version two of the Eris ransomware are made up of six packages.

      <description>Time For Some Function Recovery Binaries compiled with the Go compiler includes a large set of metadata. This metadata can be used to assist static analysis of stripped binaries. Stripped binaries, especially statically compiled, are hard to analyze. Since the symbols have been removed and the huge number of subroutines, hello world binary in Go have thousands of subroutines, it can be very time-consuming. Fortunately, the metadata in the binary can be used to reconstruct symbols and also recover information about the source code layout.</description>

      <description>Say Hello to Moduledata The moduledata structure is a data table that was first introduced in version 1.5 of Go. It is a structure that holds important information that is needed when you statically analyzing Go binaries. It records information about the layout of the executable. For ELF binaries, the structure can be found in the .noptrdata section. In PE files it is much harder to find. Sometimes it is located in the .</description>
