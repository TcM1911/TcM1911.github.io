      <description>Orthrus is a crypto-mining malware targeting both Windows and Linux machines. One of the first analyses of the Linux version of the malware was published by Antiy in June 2019. Since then, the threat actor has evolved the malware to also infect Windows servers. Orthrus is made up of four different modules written in Powershell, shell script, and binary executables. The binary executables are written in Go (Golang) and the Linux and Windows versions or compiled from the same source code.</description>

      <description>A while back I came across two projects that automate the creation of virtual machines for malware analysis. The original open source project what uses Packer and Vagrant to bootstrap a malware lab can be found here. As part of this blog post, I will instead use malboxes from GoSecure as it suits my need more.
Malboxes creates a Windows VM template using packer. The template will have tools installed. Every time a new malware is analyzed, a new VM is created using vagrant.</description>
