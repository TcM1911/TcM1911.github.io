      <description>The Raspberry Pi 4 is a nice little powerful device. The official Linux distribution for the Pi, Raspbian. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t have any prebuilt binaries for Keybase. Neither are they provided by Keybase themselves. Luckily, building it from the source is relatively painless. With the new more powerful version 4 of the pi, the time it takes is somewhat reasonable.
The goal of this blog post is to show how to set up a build environment that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require root access to the machine.</description>
