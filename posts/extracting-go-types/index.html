<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Go is a strongly typed language. This means that you can&rsquo;t concatenate for
example a string with an integer without first converting the integer to a
string. For this to be enforced, there needs to be a way for the runtime to
track all the different types. In terms of Go, all the types have a definition
that is included in the binary. By parsing all of these type definitions, it
is possible to reconstruct all the types inside the binary which can aid the
analysis of a suspicious application/malware. This post will walk through where
this data is located, how to extract and parse it so the type definitions can
be reconstructed for all the types in the binary.</p>

<h1 id="it-all-starts-with-moduledata">It all starts with moduledata</h1>

<p>As described in a <a href="../../posts/hello-moduledata/">previous blog post</a>, the
moduledata structure holds a pointer to some very important data structures in
the Go binary. For recovering type-information, we are mainly interested in
two data structures: <code>types</code> and <code>typelinks</code>. Below is the current moduledata
structure as of this writing.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type moduledata struct {
	pclntable    []byte
	ftab         []functab
	filetab      []uint32
	findfunctab  uintptr
	minpc, maxpc uintptr

	text, etext           uintptr
	noptrdata, enoptrdata uintptr
	data, edata           uintptr
	bss, ebss             uintptr
	noptrbss, enoptrbss   uintptr
	end, gcdata, gcbss    uintptr
	types, etypes         uintptr

	textsectmap []textsect
	typelinks   []int32 // offsets from types
	itablinks   []*itab

	ptab []ptabEntry

	pluginpath string
	pkghashes  []modulehash

	modulename   string
	modulehashes []modulehash

	hasmain uint8 // 1 if module contains the main function, 0 otherwise

	gcdatamask, gcbssmask bitvector

	typemap map[typeOff]*_type // offset to *_rtype in previous module

	bad bool // module failed to load and should be ignored

	next *moduledata
}
</code></pre>

<p>The moduledata structure has been relatively stable in the last few releases of
the Go compiler. In version <em>1.8</em> the field <code>textsectmap</code> was added which means
the offset for the <code>typelinks</code> slice is different between 1.7 and 1.8+, the
moduledata structure for 1.7 is shown below, otherwise, it has been unchanged.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type moduledata struct {
	pclntable    []byte
	ftab         []functab
	filetab      []uint32
	findfunctab  uintptr
	minpc, maxpc uintptr

	text, etext           uintptr
	noptrdata, enoptrdata uintptr
	data, edata           uintptr
	bss, ebss             uintptr
	noptrbss, enoptrbss   uintptr
	end, gcdata, gcbss    uintptr
	types, etypes         uintptr

	typelinks []int32 // offsets from types
	itablinks []*itab

	modulename   string
	modulehashes []modulehash

	gcdatamask, gcbssmask bitvector

	typemap map[typeOff]*_type // offset to *_rtype in previous module

	next *moduledata
}
</code></pre>

<p>All the type-information is located in the <code>types</code> data. The <code>types</code> data not
only holds the type-information, but it also holds other data about the types.
To find the type-information, the <code>typelinks</code> slice is needed. This slice holds
offsets from the beginning of the <code>types</code> to where the information of a type is
stored.  Unfortunately, offsets for all types are not located within this slice,
but it is still possible to find all types using this array.</p>

<h1 id="parsing-the-type-information">Parsing the type-information</h1>

<p>The offsets in the <code>typelinks</code> points to a data structure that describes the
type. The data structure is used by Go track all the different types within the
binary. The structure is defined in three places: the compiler, the <em>reflect</em>
package, and the <em>runtime</em> package. In the <em>runtime</em> package, the name of the
structure is <code>_type</code> and in the <em>reflect</em> package it is called <code>rtype</code>. The
definition of the <code>rtype</code> structure is shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type rtype struct {
	size       uintptr
	ptrdata    uintptr  // number of bytes in the type that can contain pointers
	hash       uint32   // hash of type; avoids computation in hash tables
	tflag      tflag    // extra type-information flags
	align      uint8    // alignment of variable with this type
	fieldAlign uint8    // alignment of struct field with this type
	kind       uint8    // enumeration for C
	alg        *typeAlg // algorithm table
	gcdata     *byte    // garbage collection data
	str        nameOff  // string form
	ptrToThis  typeOff  // type for pointer to this type, may be zero
}
</code></pre>

<p>As said earlier, all types in the binary have a corresponding <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code>
structure. This includes all the primitive types and user-defined types.  The
kind field is an <em>enum</em> value corresponding to the underlying primitive type. All
the possible options are shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">const (
	Invalid Kind = iota
	Bool
	Int
	Int8
	Int16
	Int32
	Int64
	Uint
	Uint8
	Uint16
	Uint32
	Uint64
	Uintptr
	Float32
	Float64
	Complex64
	Complex128
	Array
	Chan
	Func
	Interface
	Map
	Ptr
	Slice
	String
	Struct
	UnsafePointer
)
</code></pre>

<p>Another interesting field is <code>str</code>. This value is an offset from the beginning
of the <em>types</em> data to where a packed byte structure exists with the type&rsquo;s
name and other string information. For example, the primitive type <code>Int</code> will
also have the name of <code>int</code>, but derived types are different. Say you have
defined a type <code>superInt</code> as below. Its name would be <em>superInt</em> while the kind
enum is an <code>Int</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type superInt int
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tflag</code> field is a bitmask that is used to inform about potentially other
data after the structure as described in the source code snippet shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// tflag is used by an rtype to signal what extra type-information is
// available in the memory directly following the rtype value.
//
// tflag values must be kept in sync with copies in:
//	cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go
//	cmd/link/internal/ld/decodesym.go
//	runtime/type.go
type tflag uint8

const (
	// tflagUncommon means that there is a pointer, *uncommonType,
	// just beyond the outer type structure.
	//
	// For example, if t.Kind() == Struct and t.tflag&amp;tflagUncommon != 0,
	// then t has uncommonType data and it can be accessed as:
	//
	//	type tUncommon struct {
	//		structType
	//		u uncommonType
	//	}
	//	u := &amp;(*tUncommon)(unsafe.Pointer(t)).u
	tflagUncommon tflag = 1 &lt;&lt; 0

	// tflagExtraStar means the name in the str field has an
	// extraneous '*' prefix. This is because for most types T in
	// a program, the type *T also exists and reusing the str data
	// saves binary size.
	tflagExtraStar tflag = 1 &lt;&lt; 1

	// tflagNamed means the type has a name.
	tflagNamed tflag = 1 &lt;&lt; 2
)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="an-uncommontype">An uncommonType</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, some times can be uncommon types.  So
what are uncommon types? It turns out that they are more common than you think.
In Go, any type can have methods associated with it. This is done by the
example shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type T struct{}

func (t T) myMethod()
</code></pre>

<p>In the code snippet, <code>myMethod</code> is method for the type <code>T</code>. This makes <code>T</code> an
uncommon type. In other words, uncommon types are types with methods.</p>

<p>Information about the type&rsquo;s methods is defined in the <code>uncommon</code> structure.
As described in the section above, this structure is located right after the
type structure. The layout of the <code>uncommonType</code> structure is shown below.  It
holds information about the import path, the number of methods (total and
exported), and an offset from this structure to an array of method data
structures.  This is the current definition of the structure as the release of
Go 1.13beta1 and its general shape has been like this since the first release
of Go 1.7. Versions before 1.7 have a very different look.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type uncommonType struct {
	pkgPath nameOff // import path; empty for built-in types like int, string
	mcount  uint16  // number of methods
	xcount  uint16  // number of exported methods
	moff    uint32  // offset from this uncommontype to [mcount]method
	_       uint32  // unused
}
</code></pre>

<p>Go 1.7beta1 was the first release with the new design of this structure. Its
<code>uncommonType</code> is shown below. It is much smaller than the current one, but it
essentially holds the same information. This structure definition is unique and
does not exist any binaries produced by other versions of the Go compiler.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type uncommonType struct {
	pkgPath nameOff // import path; empty for built-in types like int, string
	mcount  uint16  // number of methods
	moff    uint16  // offset from this uncommontype to [mcount]method
}
</code></pre>

<p>The general shape of the structure was released with the release of Go
1.7beta2.  It is the same size as the current structure but the <code>xcount</code> field
is unused.  For extracting the methods, this has no noticeable effect.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type uncommonType struct {
	pkgPath nameOff // import path; empty for built-in types like int, string
	mcount  uint16  // number of methods
	_       uint16  // unused
	moff    uint32  // offset from this uncommontype to [mcount]method
	_       uint32  // unused
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the fields in the structure, <code>moff</code>, points to an array of <code>method</code>
structures. The definition of this structure is shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Method on non-interface type
type method struct {
	name nameOff // name of method
	mtyp typeOff // method type (without receiver)
	ifn  textOff // fn used in interface call (one-word receiver)
	tfn  textOff // fn used for normal method call
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mtyp</code> field is an offset to the function type for the method. It is a
<code>_type/rtype</code> structure with the kind value of <code>Func</code>. More on this type later.
Both of the <code>ifn</code> and <code>tfn</code> fields points to offsets in the <em>text</em> section of
the binary. This where function code is located.</p>

<p>When analyzing real binaries, it turns out that some methods do not have a
method type or an offset in the text section. Below is an analysis of a binary.
In the snippet, the method array for <code>*strconv.decimal</code> is walked and the
values are printed. It can be seen that most of them do not have a method type
and some of the functions do not have offsets to function code.</p>

<pre><code>*strconv.decimal has 9 methods
Method 1 name: Assign
Function at 0x58930 and 0x58930
Method 2 name: Round
Function at 0x59170 and 0x59170
Method 3 name: RoundDown
Function at 0x592d0 and 0x592d0
Method 4 name: RoundUp
Function at 0x59320 and 0x59320
Method 5 name: RoundedInteger
Function at 0x0 and 0x0
Method 6 name: Shift
Function at 0x590a0 and 0x590a0
Method 7 name: String
Method type: func() string
Function at 0x58310 and 0x58310
Method 8 name: floatBits
Function at 0x0 and 0x0
Method 9 name: set
Method type: func(string) bool
Function at 0x0 and 0x0
</code></pre>

<p>The symbols in the binary, shown below, also confirms that some functions are
missing.</p>

<pre><code>0x00458720  sym.strconv.__decimal_.String
0x00458bf0  sym.strconv.__decimal_.Assign
0x00459130  sym.strconv.__decimal_.Shift
0x00459200  sym.strconv.__decimal_.Round
0x004592d0  sym.strconv.__decimal_.RoundUp
0x00459710  sym.strconv.__extFloat_.FixedDecimal
0x00459c10  sym.strconv.__extFloat_.ShortestDecimal
0x0045e210  sym.type..hash.strconv.decimal
0x0045e270  sym.type..eq.strconv.decimal
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that the Go compiler does some
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48688822/will-go-compilers-ignore-unused-functions">pruning</a>
of methods that are not used. While not all information is always present, the
name of the method is still available which can be used for further analysis.</p>

<h1 id="some-of-go-types">Some of Go Types</h1>

<p>Each primitive type has a corresponding data type in the runtime. All of these
data types are structures and the <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> is the first field. It is an
anonymous field so hence embedded. This means, when parsing the type data, all
the extra data for the specific type is usually located right after the
<code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> data. The <code>kind</code> field can be used to figure out what type and
what data will be right after the <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> structure.</p>

<h2 id="struct-type">Struct type</h2>

<p>The <code>structType</code> data type, shown below, is used to store information about
each type derived from the primitive <code>struct</code> type. It has two extra field,
<code>pkgPath</code>, and <code>fields</code>. The <code>pkgPath</code> field is the import name of the package
while the <code>fields</code> is a slice of <code>structField</code>, also shown below, which are
used to store information about the fields. The <code>structField</code> structure has
three fields. The first one is the name of the field, the second is a pointer
to a <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> structure that can be used to determine the type of the
field, the last is an integer that encodes the offset and if the field is
embedded/anonymous.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// structType represents a struct type.
type structType struct {
	rtype
	pkgPath name
	fields  []structField // sorted by offset
}

// Struct field
type structField struct {
	name        name    // name is always non-empty
	typ         *rtype  // type of field
	offsetEmbed uintptr // byte offset of field&lt;&lt;1 | isEmbedded
}

func (f *structField) offset() uintptr {
	return f.offsetEmbed &gt;&gt; 1
}

func (f *structField) embedded() bool {
	return f.offsetEmbed&amp;1 != 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>struct</code> type has some methods attached to it, it is an uncommon type.
In this scenario, the uncommon data structure is right after the <code>structType</code>
data as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type structTypeUncommon struct {
	structType
	u uncommonType
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pointer-type">Pointer type</h2>

<p>Pointers to types have their own type called <code>ptrType</code>, it is shown in the
code block below. It essentially just adds a pointer to a <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> for
the type it points to. This means, for example, <code>*int</code> and <code>*uint</code> are two
different types and have their own <code>ptrType</code> structure stored in the binary.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// ptrType represents a pointer type.
type ptrType struct {
	rtype
	elem *rtype // pointer element (pointed at) type
}
</code></pre>

<p>One note when it comes to methods. If a pointer receiver is used when defining
a method, as seen in the example below, the methods will be attached to <code>*myThing</code>
and not <code>myThing</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type myThing struct{}

func (m *myThing) DoSomething()
</code></pre>

<h2 id="interface-type">Interface type</h2>

<p>The data structure for interfaces is simple and is shown below. It has
essentially two additional fields. One for the import pathname and a slice of
<code>imethod</code>. The <code>imethod</code> structure, also shown below, provides information
about the functions that need to be implemented to satisfy the interface. The
first field in the <code>imethod</code> structure is the name. This is the function name.
The second field is the offset to a <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> structure. This structure
is of the &ldquo;kind&rdquo; function and hence provide information about the function
definition, i.e., types for the function arguments and return values.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// interfaceType represents an interface type.
type interfaceType struct {
	rtype
	pkgPath name      // import path
	methods []imethod // sorted by hash
}

// imethod represents a method on an interface type
type imethod struct {
	name nameOff // name of method
	typ  typeOff // .(*FuncType) underneath
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="map-type">Map type</h2>

<p>The map type is probably the most complex structures of all the types.  It is
shown below. It has information about a bunch of sizes that are used under the
hood. Luckily, this is created by the compiler and the programmer has no
control over it so it can be ignored. The fields that are of interest are
<code>key</code> and <code>elem</code>.  By parsing these values, it is possible to reconstruct the
source code representation of the type definition. The fields are pointers to
two <code>_type</code>/<code>rtype</code> structures and essentially corresponds to <code>map[key]elem</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// mapType represents a map type.
type mapType struct {
	rtype
	key        *rtype // map key type
	elem       *rtype // map element (value) type
	bucket     *rtype // internal bucket structure
	keysize    uint8  // size of key slot
	valuesize  uint8  // size of value slot
	bucketsize uint16 // size of bucket
	flags      uint32
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="slice-and-array-type">Slice and array type</h2>

<p>The slice and array types are very similar, both shown below. The slice type
information is recorded in the <code>elem</code> field and for arrays, the length is stored
in the <code>len</code> field.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// sliceType represents a slice type.
type sliceType struct {
	rtype
	elem *rtype // slice element type
}

// arrayType represents a fixed array type.
type arrayType struct {
	rtype
	elem  *rtype // array element type
	slice *rtype // slice type
	len   uintptr
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="channel-type">Channel type</h2>

<p>Similar to the array, slice, and map type, the <code>chanType</code> also has a field
called <code>elem</code> to track what type is sent over the channel. It also has an enum
to indicate if the channel only can receive, only send, or send and receive.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// chanType represents a channel type.
type chanType struct {
	rtype
	elem *rtype  // channel element type
	dir  uintptr // channel direction (ChanDir)
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="function-type">Function type</h2>

<p>Since functions in Go are first-class citizens, there is also a type
definition for function types. The following code snippet is taken from the
standard library describing the type. Since it&rsquo;s possible for all types to have
methods, making them an <code>uncommonType</code>, function types can also have methods.
When this happens, the code snippet below describes how the data is stored in
the binary. The <code>funcType</code> just has two additional fields after the
<code>rtype</code>/<code>_type</code> structure, a <code>uint16</code> for the number of function arguments and
a <code>uint16</code> for the number of function return values. The type-information for
the function arguments and return values are stored in an array right after the
funcType data structure.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// funcType represents a function type.
//
// A *rtype for each in and out parameter is stored in an array that
// directly follows the funcType (and possibly its uncommonType). So
// a function type with one method, one input, and one output is:
//
//	struct {
